"""
Adapt the for loop in the sample code to use enumerate() and use two iterator variables.
Update the print() statement so that on each run, a line of the form "room x: y" should be printed, where x is the index of the list element and y is the actual list element, i.e. the area. Make sure to print out this exact string, with the correct spacing.
