Using the iterators lab and row, adapt the code in the for loop such that the first iteration prints out "US: 809", the second iteration "AUS: 731", and so on.
The output should be in the form "country: cars_per_cap". Make sure to print out this exact string (with the correct spacing).
You can use str() to convert your integer data to a string so that you can print it in conjunction with the country label.
